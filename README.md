# Privacy Policy — La Familia Social

**Last updated:** October 2025 
**Applies to:** La Familia Social (collectively, the “Services”) 
**Controller / Data Fiduciary:** OMATWT (“we”, “us”, “our”)

> This India–Hybrid policy is tailored for users in India and aligns with the **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act)** and the **Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021** (as amended). If any term here conflicts with a country-specific policy presented in-app, this India policy governs for users located in India.

## 1) What We Collect

**Account & Profile**
- Email, username/display name, profile photo, bio, and any other details you choose to add.

**User Content**
- Posts, comments, reactions, direct messages, and media you upload. 
- Direct messages are encrypted **in transit and at rest**. Where supported, one-to-one messages use **end-to-end encryption** so only sender and recipient can read them.

**Duplicate-Image Detection (Anti-Spam)**
- When you upload an image, we compute a **non-reversible perceptual hash** (an image “fingerprint”). 
- The **same image** may be uploaded **twice**; a **third** attempt is blocked automatically to reduce spam. 
- We store only the fingerprint and minimal counters required to enforce this rule; we **do not** share these fingerprints with third parties.

**Device & Usage**
- App version, OS, crash logs, diagnostics, coarse analytics (e.g., feature usage counts). 
- We **do not** use this data for cross-app tracking or advertising.

**Optional Signals (only if you opt in)**
- Contacts discovery, approximate location in posts, push notification tokens.

**Cookies / Local Storage (web)**
- For sign-in session continuity, security, and basic analytics.

---

## 2) Why We Process Your Data (Lawful Bases)

Under the DPDP Act, we rely on:
- **Consent**: For optional features (e.g., contacts discovery, notifications) and where required by law. 
- **Legitimate Uses**: To provide and secure the Services, prevent spam/abuse, comply with legal obligations, and communicate essential service notices.

You may withdraw consent at any time via in-app Settings or by contacting us (see **Section 11**). Withdrawal does not affect prior processing.

---

## 3) How We Use Data

- Provide core social + messaging features (feeds, profiles, DMs). 
- Improve performance, reliability, and safety (including moderation and rate-limiting). 
- Enforce duplicate-image limits and other anti-abuse protections. 
- Debug issues (crash logs/diagnostics) and measure stability. 
- Communicate important service updates and policy changes. 
- Comply with laws and enforce our terms.

We **do not** sell, rent, or trade your personal data.

---

## 4) Sharing & Disclosure

We share data only:
- **With service providers** that host, store, or process data on our instructions and under contract (e.g., cloud infrastructure, crash analytics). 
- **For legal compliance** when required by law or valid legal process. 
- **For security** to detect, prevent, or address fraud, abuse, or technical issues.

## 5) International Transfers (India → Abroad)

Your data may be processed and stored in the **United States** and/or other regions where our cloud providers operate. Transfers are conducted per applicable Indian law (including any government-notified country restrictions, if/when applicable). We apply appropriate safeguards and contractual commitments with processors.

## 6) Retention

- **User Content:** Kept to provide the service (e.g., your posts and messages) until you delete it or delete your account. 
- **Duplicate-Image Fingerprints:** Retained only as needed to enforce the duplicate rule and protect the service; deleted when no longer required or upon account deletion. 
- **Diagnostics/Logs:** Retained for a limited period to improve stability and troubleshoot issues.

When you delete your account, we delete or de-identify your personal data subject to legal holds or legitimate business needs (e.g., fraud prevention, dispute resolution).

## 8) Children

Our Services are **not directed to children under 18** in India. If you are under 18, you must not use the Services without **verifiable parental/guardian consent** as required by law. If we learn we collected personal data from a child contrary to this requirement, we will delete it.

---

## 9) Security

We use encryption, access controls, and industry-standard safeguards appropriate to the nature of the data. No method is 100% secure; we continually improve our protections. If a personal-data breach occurs that is likely to cause harm, we will notify the **Data Protection Board of India** and affected users as required.
